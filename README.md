## good morning sisters <br>

it is a beautiful day outside - <br>
today marks 80 years <br>
since our world wide web leader, <br>
**HEDY LAMARR**, <br>
liberated us <br>
from the shackles of patriarchy <br>
and created this new, free space. <br>
time to: <br>
get up, <br>
get off ;) <br>
and get on!<br>
<br>
and - whatever you do -<br>
don't forget<br>
A.H.H <br>
*all hail hedy!*
